# Isaac ROS Jetson

Isaac ROS Jetson

## Overview

Isaac ROS Jetson simplifies the process of monitoring and managing NVIDIA Jetson, empowering developers to optimize performance, ensure system stability, and streamline development workflows for ROS 2.

## What is `jetson-stats`?

[jetson_stats](https://rnext.it/jetson_stats) is a comprehensive utility tool specifically designed for NVIDIA Jetson, including the Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1, TX2, Xavier, and Orin series.
It provides a variety of functionalities to monitor and manage the Jetson deviceâ€™s performance, temperature, power usage, and more.

## How Does it Work with Isaac ROS?

The Isaac ROS Jetson Stats package wraps the output from the [jetson_stats](https://rnext.it/jetson_stats) package and publishes a diagnostic message with the status of your device.
It remaps all board statuses to the desired format for more accessible analysis and monitoring.

The package provides the following features:
: * System Monitoring
  * Fan Control
  * GPU Frequency Control
  * Power Management
  * Thermal Throttling Monitoring
  * Memory Usage
  * JetPack Version Detection

To learn more about Jetson Stats, refer to the [jetson_stats](https://rnext.it/jetson_stats) documentation.

## Why use in `isaac_ros_jetson` on my robotics application?

ROS designed a tool for aggregating diagnostics messages published from other nodes that publish these messages and republish them in a single diagnostic topic.
This makes it easier to monitor and manage the diagnostics of a ROS system, especially in complex robotic systems where multiple nodes may be publishing diagnostic information.

Isaac ROS Jetson provides a set of messages to monitor the health of your board while the robot is working and tracking what is happening.

As an illustration, consider a scenario where your board is under high power demand. In such a case, a node that reads the diagnostics message can dynamically adjust the `nvp` power mode or even disable certain nodes that are consuming excessive computational resources. This dynamic power management capability is a key feature of the tool.

Using the `isaac_ros_jetson` package in a Docker container can greatly improve the robustness and reliability of your project. This method ensures a consistent and isolated environment, reducing compatibility issues and making deployment across different platforms easier.
